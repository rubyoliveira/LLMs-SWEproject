3. Spotify (True Random + AI Discovery)

Solves one problem: Breaks users out of predictable, repetitive algorithmic music loops.

Target customers: Heavy music listeners frustrated by repetitive shuffles.

Infrastructure: Spotify Web API (very accessible).

Reimagines space: Replaces engagement-optimized clustering with mathematically true randomness.

LLM Core: An LLM analyzes track metadata to intentionally select "blind spot" genres to inject into the random queue.

Validation Guardrail: A script checks the generated queue to ensure zero artist/genre repeats within a set timeframe.

Self-Correction: If a repeat is detected, the LLM is fed the duplicate error and forced to regenerate a new track selection.

Deployability: Easily deployable as a third-party Spotify-connected app.
